        "Across industries, organizations commonly use time series data, which means any information collected over a regular interval of time, in their operations. Examples include daily stock prices, energy consumption rates, social media engagement metrics and retail demand, among others. Analyzing time series data yields insights like trends, seasonal patterns and forecasts into future events that can help generate profits. \n",
        "\n",
        "When analyzing time series data, you should undertake a number of steps. First, you need to check for stationarity and autocorrelation. Stationarity is a way to measure if the data has structural patterns like seasonal trends. Autocorrelation occurs when future values in a time series linearly depend on past values. You need to check for both of these in time series data because they’re assumptions that are made by many widely used methods in time series analysis. For example, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method for forecasting time series assumes stationarity. Further, linear regression for time series forecasting assumes that the data has no autocorrelation. Before conducting these processes, then, you need to know if the data is viable for the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "During a time series analysis in Python, you also need to perform trend decomposition and forecast future values. Decomposition allows you to visualize trends in your data, which is a great way to clearly explain their behavior. Finally, forecasting allows you to anticipate future events that can aid in decision making. You can use many different techniques for time series forecasting, but here, we will discuss the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)."
